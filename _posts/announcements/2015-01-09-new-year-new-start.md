Happy 2015 guys. BestTeaMaker here to tell you about some updates. Youâ€™ll probably have noticed that our rulesets have been updated and changed (give your thanks to Electric91 whenever you get the chance). A few things of note to report.

First, we are transitioning to FLSS for stage selection for our Wii U Weekly tournaments. Hypest veterans will have been familiar with this system for our 3DS tournaments, but for the new people, let me give you the run down. In this system, instead of dividing stages between starter and counterpick, both players will strike for the first game from the entire stagelist. This allows the players to essentially choose which stage is the fairest to start the first game on. With 13 stages available, we want players to be able to learn the metagame for all stages, not just Smashville/Battlefield/Final Destination. We believe that learning about these stages will help to enhance the competitive scene as a whole.

Second, we are now using TPS rules for the Swiss pools. This enables us to seed players in pools as well as help solve lag disputes. Essentially, the better you do in our tournaments, the higher your TPS score. If in the case that your match is lagging very badly, then you are allowed to call for TPS to settle the game. However, you are only allowed to declare TPS once per match, and only a certain number of times during the entirety of the tournament. Furthermore, in the case that time for the round runs out and you are still in the middle of a match, if you had declared TPS in that match, you will then lose. We hope that this system will help speed up pools and ensure that our tournament runs in a timely manner.

One more special announcement. As you know, we have teamed up with Events2Compete and RTGN.tv to host a large online tournament, Smash 4 Worldwide. Already we have more than a thousand signups, and hopefully even more as the time passes. So prepare your calendars for January 18th for one of the largest online tournaments in Smash history.

Anyways, from the Hypest Team, we thank you guys for continuing to support and attend our events. Have a smashing new year!
