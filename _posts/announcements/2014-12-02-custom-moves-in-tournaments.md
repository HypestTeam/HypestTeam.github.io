So, I love custom movesets. They’re probably one of the most interesting additions to the game that makes this game mechanically standout. There was a post on Smashboards by Thinkaman, where he statistically showed [why custom movesets would benefit the competitive metagame of Smash 4](http://smashboards.com/threads/the-anticipated-impact-of-custom-special-moves-on-gameplay-and-balance-statistics.366457/). They give characters like Ganondorf and Palutena a big boost in competitive viability (Ganondorf placed 3rd and Palutena 6th in previous weeklies). So, all in all, custom movesets are great.

However, in online tournaments, they’re hard to check. We don’t want to use equipment in competitive play due to the way that they affect gameplay. In live tournies, it’s as simple as looking at the character to tell whether or not they’re using equipment. The same is not true for online tourneys. Basically, people are able to secretly bring in equipment to our events. And during our last tournament, that exact thing happened during our Top 12 last week.

But, after a few days of thinking about it, we realized that we shouldn’t let the few people who break the rules ruin this event with everyone. Already, we’re seeing big tournaments take custom movesets in a positive light. We want to be a part of that, so we’re keeping custom movesets in our tournaments.

However, this is a two-way thing. In order for us to be able to run these events, we need to know that we can trust players to not break rules like this. So, we’re going to institute a blanket ban on people who break this rule. Basically, people who are break our rules purposefully will be banned from any event that we or the subreddit run. If it gets to the point where that person is doing this multiple times, then we have no choice but to publicly call him or her out. We don’t want to start a witch hunt, but it is important to let people know who are willing to break the rules.

If you wish to report someone breaking rules like this, or any other, do not hesitate to let us know. We will do our best to help. We are here for you.

Anyways, long story short, we’re allowing custom movesets in our tournaments. Please don’t ruin this for us and the players.
